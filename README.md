# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Modeling Epidemic Spreading (GN-ODE)
## Predicting SIR model on Large Complex Networks

Network Datasets are in the **real_graphs folder**.\\
SIR labels for $t \in [0,...T]$ are extracted using Monte-Carlo simulations on the undirected/unweighted preprocessed graphs.
